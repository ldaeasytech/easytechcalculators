<h2>Units and Why They Matter</h2>

<p>
Units are the language of engineering and science. A numerical value without
a unit has no physical meaning. Writing “10” alone is ambiguous — it could
represent 10 meters, 10 seconds, 10 kilograms, or 10 Pascals.
</p>

<p>
Units allow engineers to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communicate physical quantities clearly</li>
  <li>Maintain dimensional consistency</li>
  <li>Verify equations using dimensional analysis</li>
  <li>Prevent costly engineering mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p>
Incorrect unit usage has caused real-world failures in aerospace, mechanical,
and civil engineering systems.
</p>

<h2>Why Do We Have SI and English Systems of Units?</h2>

<p>
Two major systems of measurement are commonly used in engineering:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SI (International System of Units)</strong> — used worldwide in science and most industries</li>
  <li><strong>English / US Customary Units</strong> — still widely used in the United States and certain industries</li>
</ul>

<p>
The SI system is decimal-based and coherent, meaning derived units are
direct combinations of base units. The English system evolved historically
and uses non-decimal relationships (e.g., 12 inches per foot, 5280 feet per mile).
</p>

<p>
Because industry, design standards, and regulations vary by country,
engineers must often convert between systems.
</p>

<h2>Why Not Just Use One System for Everything?</h2>

<p>
In principle, a single global system would simplify engineering.
In practice, infrastructure, manufacturing standards, and legal codes
were developed over centuries.
</p>

<p>
Switching entirely to one system would require:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Redesigning equipment</li>
  <li>Updating industrial standards</li>
  <li>Rewriting regulatory codes</li>
  <li>Replacing measurement tools</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a result, engineers must be fluent in both systems.
</p>

<h2>How Do We Convert Between Units?</h2>

<p>
This converter uses a <strong>base-unit normalization method</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert the input value to the base SI unit.</li>
  <li>Convert from the base unit to the target unit.</li>
</ol>

<p>
For example, converting pressure from psi to MPa:
</p>

<p>
1 psi = 6894.757 Pa  
1 MPa = 1,000,000 Pa  
</p>

<p>
By normalizing through Pascals (Pa), dimensional consistency is maintained.
</p>

<p>
This approach ensures accuracy and extensibility for all derived properties.
</p>

<h2>Fundamental (Basic) Units</h2>

<p>
Fundamental units form the foundation of dimensional analysis.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mass (kg)</strong> — Dimension [M]</li>
  <li><strong>Length (m)</strong> — Dimension [L]</li>
  <li><strong>Time (s)</strong> — Dimension [T]</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature (K)</strong> — Dimension [Θ]</li>
</ul>

<p>
All other engineering quantities are derived combinations of these.
</p>

<h2>Derived Units</h2>

<p>
Derived units are formed by combining fundamental dimensions.
Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> m/s → [L T⁻¹]</li>
  <li><strong>Force:</strong> N = kg·m/s² → [M L T⁻²]</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Pa = N/m² → [M L⁻¹ T⁻²]</li>
  <li><strong>Energy:</strong> J = N·m → [M L² T⁻²]</li>
  <li><strong>Power:</strong> W = J/s → [M L² T⁻³]</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dimensional formulas allow engineers to check whether equations are physically valid.
</p>

<h2>Property Reference Guide</h2>

<h3>Force</h3>
<p>
Force represents interaction between bodies and follows Newton’s Second Law:
F = m·a. The SI unit is Newton (N).
</p>

<h3>Pressure</h3>
<p>
Pressure is force per unit area (P = F/A). Common in fluid systems,
hydraulics, and thermodynamics.
</p>

<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>
Energy represents the capacity to do work. Mechanical, thermal,
and electrical energy are all measured in Joules (J).
</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>
Power is the rate of energy transfer (P = E/t). Common units include
Watt (W), kilowatt (kW), and horsepower (hp).
</p>

<h3>Momentum</h3>
<p>
Momentum equals mass times velocity (p = m·v) and is conserved
in isolated systems.
</p>

<h3>Torque</h3>
<p>
Torque is rotational force (τ = F·r) measured in N·m or lb·ft.
</p>

<h3>Density</h3>
<p>
Density (ρ = m/V) represents mass per unit volume and is essential
in fluid flow and thermodynamics.
</p>

<h3>Viscosity</h3>
<p>
Dynamic viscosity (μ) measures resistance to shear.  
Kinematic viscosity (ν = μ/ρ) relates viscosity to density.
</p>

<h3>Flow Rate</h3>
<p>
Volumetric flow rate (Q) measures volume per time.  
Mass flow rate (ṁ) accounts for fluid density.
</p>

<h3>Velocity</h3>
<p>
Velocity represents displacement per unit time and influences
Reynolds number and friction loss in pipe systems.
</p>

<h3>Thermal Conductivity</h3>
<p>
Thermal conductivity (k) measures a material’s ability to conduct heat
via Fourier’s Law.
</p>

<h3>Heat Transfer Coefficient</h3>
<p>
The convective heat transfer coefficient (h) describes heat exchange
between a surface and a moving fluid.
</p>

<h3>Specific Heat</h3>
<p>
Specific heat (c) quantifies energy required to raise temperature
per unit mass.
