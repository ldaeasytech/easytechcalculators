    <h1>About EasyTech Calculators</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>EasyTech Calculators</strong> was created on December 11, 2025 with
      the goal of helping students, teachers, engineers, and professionals
      perform everyday technical calculations quickly, reliably, and accurately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many engineering calculations are repetitive and time-sensitive.
      EasyTech Calculators aims to reduce manual effort and calculation errors
      by providing focused tools that are easy to use and technically sound.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Provide</h2>
    <p>
      This site hosts practical engineering calculators designed with clarity,
      numerical reliability, and responsible use in mind. The Water &amp; Steam
      Properties Calculator is the first of many tools planned for this platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      EasyTech Calculators will continue to expand with additional calculators
      covering common engineering and technical needs.
