    <h1>About EasyTech Calculators</h1>

<p>
  <strong>EasyTech Calculators</strong> was created on December 11, 2025 to provide
  practical, reliable, and easy-to-use engineering calculators for students,
  educators, engineers, and technical professionals.
</p>

<p>
  Many engineering calculations are repetitive, time-sensitive, and prone to
  manual error. This platform was built to simplify complex calculations while
  maintaining technical correctness and clarity.
</p>

<h2>Our Focus</h2>

<p>
  EasyTech Calculators specializes in applied engineering tools that support
  real-world analysis and design.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Thermodynamics:</strong> Water &amp; Steam property calculations</li>
  <li><strong>Pump & Fluid Flow Systems:</strong> Power requirements, operating point analysis, economic pipe sizing, NPSH evaluation, and gravity tank elevation design</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The pump and fluid flow calculators are designed to cover the complete
  workflow of hydraulic system design — from energy requirements and cavitation
  prevention to economic optimization and performance evaluation.
</p>

<h2>What Makes This Platform Different</h2>

<p>
  Each calculator is built using established engineering principles such as
  mechanical energy balance, Darcy-Weisbach friction analysis, pump affinity
  laws, and economic cost modeling.
</p>

<p>
  The goal is not just to provide numbers, but to provide tools that reflect
  proper engineering methodology.
</p>

<h2>Expanding Engineering Coverage</h2>

<p>
  EasyTech Calculators is continuously expanding into additional technical
  domains, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agricultural engineering tools (e.g., fertilizer application calculators)</li>
  <li>Psychrometric analysis and air-conditioning calculations</li>
  <li>Drying and mass transfer processes</li>
  <li>Additional fluid mechanics and thermodynamics utilities</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The long-term vision is to build a comprehensive engineering calculation
  platform covering core mechanical, agricultural, and process engineering needs.
</p>

<h2>Responsible Use</h2>

<p>
  While every effort is made to ensure numerical accuracy and correct
  implementation of formulas, all results should be independently verified
  before use in professional design or safety-critical applications.
</p>

<p>
  EasyTech Calculators is intended for educational support, preliminary design,
  and engineering analysis assistance.
